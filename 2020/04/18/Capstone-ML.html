<em>Processing video to detect a fall on camera</em></span></p>

<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<p>In my final two semesters of college I completed a capstone project in coordination with a local company - Vivint SmartHome (VSH). VSH has a line of in-home cameras that customers purchase for home security. Two fellow classmates and I were tasked with prototyping a new feature for them: automatically detecting if a person has fallen over. Our little 3-person team was multidisciplinary, and, as is the case in most undergraduate group projects, we each had varying interests in different aspects of the project. I was very interested in ML at the time and relished the opportunity to tackle a real-world problem with ML. As such, I led the effort on researching and designing the data processing, modeling, and overall ML approach, and that will be the focus of this blog post.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in using ML to process video, this walkthrough could prove highly useful; it’s a simple technical design that’s great for beginners! What follows is a conceptual overview of my specific problem, a description of my technical approach, and a presentation of my results.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Falling is a significant problem for elderly people; over 30% of population age 65+ falls annually, and falls are responsible for over 50% of hospitalizations in that demographic. Injuries and hospitalization as the result of a fall are a large risk. VHS has existing in-home security cameras that are connected to the internet. With this project, I developed an algorithm and data processing pipeline to automatically detect a fall. If this were put into production it could notify family members or emergency services immediately in the event of a fall, if the customer enabled this functionality. (For example, if a family installs such a system in the home of their elderly relative, they could enable this feature. When grandkids come to visit, they could disable it to avoid unnecessary alerts.)</p>

<h3 id="initial-assumptions">Initial Assumptions</h3>
<p>Since this was a simple proof-of-concept project for VHS, we allowed ourselves several limiting assumptions in our data set. These assumptions were:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>only one person in the frame at a time</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the falling motion of the individual is perpendicular to the camera</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>no concept of recovering from a fall, i.e. if a fall is detected on camera, it is classified as a fall even if the individual gets back up after the fall.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>fall event not occluded; the majority of the fall event is visible to the camera and not hidden behind furniture, etc.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="data-collection">Data Collection</h2>
<p>Since no relatively simple, labeled data set was available to us, we curated our data set ourselves — that’s right, we filmed ourselves falling over and over again in a controlled environment, much to the pleasure of our fellow classmates and professors.</p>

<p><strong><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/yLIW123xhS-M4f8RM4OZdpfsA4Q_2_8iXUpd0X4MbEPy9V7QmSH9Z6WR94hdI2Th3HZ_G-HC-KnBB2M_XTdCtvflZUrGC_dsKJPbZv-zqrWGl8IYNqoTDv29zX5XefiClyOAb0uoEtg" alt="" /></strong></p>

<p>Subjects purposefully varied in height, width, and color of apparel to give variety to our data set and prevent models from learning from inappropriate, non-generalizable features.</p>

<p>A data augmentation process was employed to generate multiple two-second clips (60 frames for 30fps cameras) from a single video. Borrowing the concept of stride from CNNs, a stride length of 30 frames was used to capture overlap between clips. The process is shown below with an eight second video (240 frames), which generates seven distinct two-second data points.</p>

<p>This resulted in a dataset of 424 2-second videos. To match the natural imbalance between fall and non-fall videos, 20% of our dataset are clips of fall events and the other 80% are clips of non-fall events.</p>
