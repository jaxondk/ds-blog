I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science at Brigham Young University with a Business Minor. Most of my internships were all for software development positions, and then around my senior year I realized I was fascinated with machine learning and wanted to pivot into that field. I was fortunate enough to land a position as a Machine Learning Researcher at Stratesis Technologies, LLC - a technology-based hedge fund. While there I discovered the fastai library and have worked hard to transition the company to deep learning.

My dream is to solve real-world problems - especially in the lives of those who suffer disproportionately. I feel that I have  received so much but up to this point have given so little in comparison. I hope to acquire skill sets that will allow me to fulfill this dream, and I believe I am making real progress to that end. If any of you are working on solving societal problems such as poverty, homelessness, recidivism, healthcare, etc. -- especially by using data science -- please feel free to contact me using the links in the footer.

I also think about the potential of humanity developing Artificial Super Intelligence in my lifetime, and I'm concerned about the consequences of such a development. It seems that no matter what we do, many actors (businesses, institutions, and entire governemnts) will race toward developing ASI despite the immense negative consequences it could have. If done safely, however, I am also excited about the incredible opportunities. All of the societal problems I discussed above could be solved by an ASI, if well-designed. Because of this, I feel we **must** strive to do what we can to progress the field of safe AGI (artificial general intelligence) and ASI.
